# themis-fb
This is a facebook plugin for the Backmeup project, which archives a facebookprofiles data in XML and generates a view in HTML and CSS. It does not require any PHP, PEARL or RUBY.
## Versions
There are two versions available for this plugin, a version, which works as plugin and one which works standalone.
### Standalone
You can find the standalone version in the master branch. You have to run it in a terminal, because it needs some paramters to work.
#### Parameters
##### Generate properties
At the first time, run this:
```sh
$ java -jar {themis-fb}.jar
```
it will only generate the config. 
##### Download
When you want to download the data of your profile run:
```sh
$ java -jar {themis-fb}.jar --download
```
Do not forget to specify the download directory in your properties.xml
##### Generate view
When you want to generate a view of your already downloaded data run:
```sh
$ java -jar {themis-fb}.jar --generate-html
```
Do not forget to specify the HTML directory in your properties.xml. When you want to open the view, go to the HTML directory and open the index.html.

You can combine all given parameter.
#### Config
The configs name is properties.xml.
##### Access Token
You can generate an access token [here](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer).
##### Limit
You can also set a limit for the amount of photos that will be downloaded per album. All numbers below 0 will download all photos. You should mind, that this can generate a lot of traffic.

If true, not all information is shown in the HTML, but the data is in the XML. You recreate the HTML with this option to false and the information will be complete. Recommend to set to false only for debugging.

#Not implemented
These items will not be fetched from your profile, because they are not implemented yet, maybe that will change in the future.
+ Videos	**"me/videos"**
+ Friendlist	**"me/friends"**	(returns only the count of the friends and friends profile, which are also registered in this app)
+ complete Group	**"me/groups"**	(is implemented but returns not many information)
+ Feeds		**"me/feeds"**	(seems to be the same like **"me/posts"**)
